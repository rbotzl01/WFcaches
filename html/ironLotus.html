<p class="a">This cache is/will be part of a collection of caches that is dedicated to Will Ferrell movies.  There is no intended order in which they should be found, and there are no clues that need to be collected at each cache to work towards a "final" puzzle cache.  Each cache, though, is designed with a particular Will Ferrell movie in mind (with a PG-13 rating or lower, unless otherwise specified).  Enjoy the caches, and the movies!

<h1 class="lotus">Iron Lotus</h1>

<p class="b">When Blades of Glory came out in 2007, it almost seemed like it needed a subtitle, as in <i><b>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</b></i> or <i><b>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</b></i>.  Maybe people had gotten sick of the subtitles, or that Will Ferrell has to share the spotlight with Jon Heder, of <i><b>Napoleon Dynamite</b></i> fame.

<p class="b"> In this movie, Will Ferrell plays Chazz Michael Michaels, the bad boy of figure skating.  Heder plays Jimmy MacElroy, the more classically trained figure skater.  Their constant feuding leads to unfortunate consequences at a competition that gets them both banned from Men's Figure Skating for life!  They do find a loophole to they're ban, by teaming up and competing in Pairs Figure Skating as the first male-male pair!

<p class="b"> When the Chazz and Jimmy continue struggling to get along as partners, their coach in desperation dusts off an old move from his past... the <strong>Iron Lotus</strong>!!  This dangerous, potentially fatal move has never worked in the past, but, if Chazz and Jimmy can pull it off, it will win the gold!

<p class="b"> This cache was hidden near a local twin ice rink facility, which has been offering skating lessons, hockey leagues, and opportunities to rent out the space for parties since it opened in 1996.  There is plenty of parking, and the cache is hidden around back, which should not draw too much attention.  There is an unactivated geocoin for the first to find, and some initial random swag.
